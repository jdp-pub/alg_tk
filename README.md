# Simularity


Purpose:
A minimal implementation of various algorithms useful in simulation and data processing, in general useful for scientific research. The design philosphy uses minimal external packages to remain lightweight as well as keeping scale in mind for high dimensional problems.

Provides:
    - general purpose simulation tools like eigenvalue solvers
    - utility tools to minimize external packages
    - tools to track simulation convergence
    - data analysis tools
    - high performance computation

Minimal Example: Ground state of ising system

'''julia

    include("../src/Simularity.jl")
    using .Simularity

    function main()
        n = 6
        #n = 14 # takes a little over 1m 

        h = zeros(2^n,2^n)
        Z = [1 0; 0 -1]
        J = 0.6435

        # set up the system, hamiltonian for nearest neighbor model
        for nx in 1: n-1
            h = h + J*Simularity.MBO([Z,Z],[nx,nx+1],n)
        end

        # conduct computation with variational method in this case
        E, E_psi = Simularity.gs(h)

     
        println("Ground state: ", E_psi)
        println("Ground state energy: ", E)
